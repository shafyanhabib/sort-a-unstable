## Introduction

Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science. It organizes data to make it easier to search, analyze, and manage. Our repository focuses on unstable sorting algorithms. Unlike stable sorts, unstable sorts do not guarantee the preservation of the relative order of equal elements. This can lead to faster performance in some cases.

## Features

- **In-Place Sorting**: The algorithms sort the data without requiring additional space.
- **Fast Performance**: Designed for efficiency, our algorithms handle large datasets quickly.
- **Unstable Sorting**: Ideal for scenarios where the order of equal elements does not matter.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Implements various sorting techniques for flexibility.

## Sorting Algorithms

In this repository, you will find implementations of several well-known sorting algorithms:

1. **Binary Insertion Sort**: An efficient version of insertion sort that uses binary search to find the correct position for each element.
2. **Heap Sort**: Utilizes a binary heap data structure to sort elements. It has a time complexity of O(n log n).
3. **Selection Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm that divides the input into a sorted and an unsorted region.
4. **Shell Sort**: An improvement over insertion sort that allows the exchange of items far apart. It reduces the number of inversions.

## Installation

To get started with **Sort-a-Unstable**, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Run the following command in your terminal:
